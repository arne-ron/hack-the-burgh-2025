# hack-the-burgh-2025
This project is our teams submission to the challenge set by Viridien for HackTheBurghXI in Edinburgh 2025.
The goal of the challenge was to upscale a colored satelite photograph of an area near Heathrow using a satelite LiDAR image with 10 times higher resolution in both directions, inheriting as much data from the LiDAR to the colored photograph as possible.
Additionally, the landscape should be analysed in regards to classification and environmental impact.

The running the main.py file performs the calculations on the data given in /data and saves the upscaled image as a "upscaled.tif" in the current folder.
Own images can be used by setting the input_path_* variables.
